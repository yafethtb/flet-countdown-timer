# flet-countdown-timer
A simple countdown app for desktop created with flet library for Python.
--
This is a simple app. User input how many seconds to count down to zero, press the button, and see the timer counting down.

To use this app you need to have Python (I use python 3.10), install flet library via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/flet/), and run this file.

I might release this as a standalone Windows app netx time.
